# BugRex - Getting started

BugRex is a website that connects developers who need help with developers who are willing to help.

It's built with Node.js app using the [Hapi.js](http://hapijs.com/) framework.


## Technologies:

- Node.js 
- Hapi.js 
- MongoDB 
- Mongoose 
- React.js 
- SASS 

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed. Then do the following:

```sh
$ npm install
$ gulp dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).


Note: It will only work if you have the correct config.js file to get the API keys. This file is obviously not shared here.
